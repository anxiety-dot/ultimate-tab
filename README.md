[Verse 1]

     <span data-name="Am" class="fciXY _Oy28" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Am</span>                  <span data-name="F" class="fciXY _Oy28" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">F</span>           <span data-name="E" class="fciXY _Oy28" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">E</span>

Some people say a man is made out o' mud

  <span data-name="Am" class="fciXY _Oy28" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Am</span>                     <span data-name="F" class="fciXY _Oy28" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">F</span>          <span data-name="E" class="fciXY _Oy28" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">E</span>

A poor man's made out o' muscle an' blood.

<span data-name="Am" class="fciXY _Oy28" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Am</span>                   <span data-name="Dm" class="fciXY _Oy28" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Dm</span>       <span data-name="F" class="fciXY _Oy28" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">F</span>

Muscle an' blood an' skin an' bones

  <span data-name="Am" class="fciXY _Oy28" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Am</span>          N.C

A mind that's weak an' a back that's strong

 

[Chorus]

              Am               F           E

     You load sixteen tons and what do you get?

      Am                   F         E

     Another day older an' deeper in debt

           Am               C              Dm      F

     Saint Peter, don't you call me 'cause I can't go

       Am     N.C

     I owe my soul to the company sto'

 

(Repeat riff)

 

[Verse 2]

      Am                        F          E

I was born one mornin' when the sun didn't shine

  Am                        F             E

I picked up my shovel and I walked to the mine

         Am              Dm          F

I loaded sixteen tons of number nine coal

        Am         N.C

And the straw boss said, "Well, bless my soul"

 

 

[Chorus]

              Am               F           E

     You load sixteen tons and what do you get?

      Am                   F         E

     Another day older an' deeper in debt

           Am               C              Dm      F

     Saint Peter, don't you call me 'cause I can't go

       Am     N.C

     I owe my soul to the company sto'

 

(Repeat riff)

 

[Verse 3]

      Am                       F         E

I was born one mornin', it was drizzlin' rain

Am                       F         E

Fightin' and trouble are my middle name

      Am                             Dm       F

I was raised in the canebrake by an' ol' mama lion

         Am        N.C

Can't no high-tone woman make me walk the line

 

[Chorus]

              Am               F           E

     You load sixteen tons and what do you get?

      Am                   F         E

     Another day older an' deeper in debt

           Am               C              Dm      F

     Saint Peter, don't you call me 'cause I can't go

       Am     N.C

     I owe my soul to the company sto'

 

(Repeat riff)

 

[Verse 4]

      Am                   F     E

If ya see me comin' better step aside

  Am                  F         E

A lotta men didn't, a lotta men died

Am                    Dm       F

One fist of iron, the other of steel

       Am              N.C

If the right one don't get you then the left one will

 

[Chorus]

              Am               F           E

     You load sixteen tons and what do you get?

      Am                   F         E

     Another day older an' deeper in debt

           Am               C              Dm      F

     Saint Peter, don't you call me 'cause I can't go

       Am     N.C

     I owe my soul to the company sto'

 

(Repeat riff)
